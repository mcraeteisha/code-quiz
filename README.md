Test your coding knowledge with this timed Coding Quiz that was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You'll start the Quiz with 75 seconds on the clock. For each wrong answer submitted, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. Your final score is the amount of time left on the clock once you've gone through all questions. At the end of the Quiz, you can submit your score and view a list of High Scores.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
 
## Work Completed

To complete this project, I created a HTML, CSS, and Javascript files to build a code quiz.

Using VS Code, I completed the following:

* Created an HTML page to display elements created with JavaScript.
* Created a CSS file. This project utlizes some Bootstrap features in addition to custom CSS styling.
* Created a JavaScript file, which does most of the heavy lifting for this application, including generating the quiz questions and storing Player Initials/High Scores and displaying that information to the page.
 
## Learnings
 
This project required some independent learning and also allowed me to apply classroom lessons to a real-world scenario.

Some of the learnings I’m taking away from this project are:
1. How to add line breaks to HTML pages uses JavaScript.
2. A better understanding of timers built with JavaScript.
3. With this project, I feel like JavaScript has become more familiar to me and I have a better understanding of what's happening when I read or think out JavaScript code. (Some concepts are still a little tricky for me—especially For Loops..)
4. I tend to get excited when starting a new project and want to dive in and immediately start putting things on the page. But, I've found that stepping away from the computer and writing my code out by hand, and thinking about how I want a page to function has proven to be the better method of getting work done. 

## Future Application Updates

* Page styling improvements
* Longer quiz with more questions
